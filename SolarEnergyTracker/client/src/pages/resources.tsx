                  answer:
                    "The cost of a solar system in Kenya typically ranges from KSh 120,000 to KSh 200,000 per kWp installed, depending on the quality of components, system type, and installation complexity. For a standard 5kWp residential system, you can expect to pay between KSh 600,000 to KSh 1,000,000.",

                  question: "How long do solar panels last?",
                  answer:
                    "Quality solar panels typically have a lifespan of 25-30 years. Most manufacturers provide performance warranties guaranteeing at least 80% of the original output after 25 years. The inverter usually has a shorter lifespan of 10-15 years and may need replacement during the panel's lifetime.",

                    "Grid-tied solar systems without batteries will shut down during a power outage for safety reasons. If you want power during outages, you'll need either a hybrid system with battery backup or an off-grid system that operates independently from the utility grid.",

                  Paying upfront for your solar system provides the highest long-term
                  returns and lowest overall cost. While requiring a significant initial
                  investment, this option eliminates financing costs and allows you to

                <p className="text-neutral-600">
                  Several Kenyan banks offer green energy loans specifically for solar
                  installations. These loans typically have terms of 3-7 years with
                  competitive interest rates. Some institutions offering solar loans
                  include Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), Cooperative Bank, and Equity Bank.

                <p className="text-neutral-600">
                  PAYG systems allow you to pay for your solar system in small,
                  manageable installments, often through mobile money. You receive the
                  system after a small deposit and make regular payments until you own it
                  outright. Companies like M-KOPA, d.light, and Azuri Technologies offer
                  these options.

                  Some companies in Kenya offer solar leases or Power Purchase Agreements
                  (PPAs) where you pay a monthly fee for the solar equipment or for the
                  power generated. These options require little to no money down but may
                  have longer contract terms (10-20 years).

                  Microfinance institutions and Savings and Credit Cooperative
                  Organizations (SACCOs) often provide smaller, more accessible loans for
                  solar systems with favorable terms for their members. These can be good
                  options for smaller systems or for those who may not qualify for
                  traditional bank loans.
